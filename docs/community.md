Most answers cloud be found in [FAQ](s-faq.md), but if your answer is not found, you can ask for help in the community. When asking, please describe the following in detail:

* Contents of the operation performed
* The result of the operation execution (**complete** screenshot or description)
* The environment in which the command was executed:
  * Is the operating system CentOS 7.8?
  * Is it a local physical/virtual machine or a cloud vendor server?
  * Is a freshly installed exclusive node used?
  * Is the offline software installation package `pkg.tgz` used?
    * If so, is the offline package placed in `/tmp/pkg.tgz`? Did you run `configure` before running the `make install` installation?
    * If not, using the offline software installer, does your node have access to the network if installed directly from the original upstream software repo? and go over the wall to access Github?
  * Are there any special security restrictions? (SSH/Sudo/DNS/Firewall, etc.)

If you find a reproducible bug, you are more than welcome to submit it on Github at [Issue](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/issues/new/choose) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/Vonng/).
